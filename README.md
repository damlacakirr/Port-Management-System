# Port Management System
 Java Project Port Management System
 In this project, you are required to implement a simulation of a port management system The main objective is to analyze the requests provided in input and carry out the necessary actions.There are ports, and ships are sailing between them. Ships are carrying the following types of containers: basic, heavy, refrigerated, liquid, and each of them should be handled differently.Containers in a port can be loaded to ships, and, conversely, they can be unloaded from a ship to port. Ships need a certain amount of fuel to sail from one port to another. Note that there is no user interaction during the execution; the program parses the input file composed of the sequential operations. In addition, as a significant remark, the signature of the methods and the field names that you are going to implement should be identical to the ones that are specified in this document. If a specific method signature is not enforced by the project description, you can feel free to implement it in your way (i.e. you can implement extra methods considering your(own design choice)). However, you should also consider the proper usage of access modifiers for preserving the desired visibility and accessibility throughout the project. In other words, you should not define everything as “public”, which results in a penalty if done so.
